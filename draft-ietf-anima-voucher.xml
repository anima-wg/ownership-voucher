      <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">

        <t>This document defines a strategy to securely assign devices to an owner, using
        an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the device's manufacturer.
        This artifact is known as the voucher.</t>

        <t>A voucher may be useful in several contexts, but the driving
        motivation herein is to support secure bootstrapping mechanisms, such as 
        are defined in <xref target="draft-ietf-netconf-zerotouch"/> and
        <xref target="draft-ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>.  Assigning
        ownership is important to bootstrapping mechanisms so that the booting
        device can authenticate the network that's trying to take control of it.</t>

        <t>The lifetimes of vouchers may vary.  In some bootstrapping protocols
        the vouchers may be ephemeral, whereas in others the vouchers may be 
        potentially long-lived.  In order to support the second category of vouchers,
        this document also defines a voucher revocation artifact, enabling the
        manufacturer or delegate to communicate the validity of its vouchers.</t>

        <t>For both artifacts, this memo only defines the artifact, leaving it
        to future work to describe specialized protocols for accessing them.</t>

        <t>This document uses YANG <xref target="RFC7950"/> to define the voucher
        and voucher revocation formats.  YANG is a data modeling language with
        established mappings to XML and JSON, with mappings to other encodings
        in progress.  Which encodings a particular solution uses is outside the
        scope of this document.</t>

      <section title="Voucher Revocation" anchor="voucher-revocation">

        <t>The vouchers revocation artifact is used to verify the revocation status
        of vouchers.  Voucher revocations are signed by the manufacturer or delegate
        (i.e. the issuer of the voucher).  Vouchers revocation statements MAY be
        verified by devices during the bootstrapping process, or at any time before
        or after by any entity (e.g., registrar or equivalent) as needed.
        Registrars or equivalent SHOULD verify voucher revocation statements
        and make policy decisions in case devices are not doing so themselves.</t>

        <t>Revocations are generally needed when it is critical
        for devices to know that assurances implied at the time the voucher was
        signed are still valid at the time the voucher is being processed.</t>

        <t>As mentioned in <xref target="introduction"/>, the lifetimes of vouchers
        may vary.  In some bootstrapping protocols the vouchers may be ephemeral,
        whereas in others the vouchers may be potentially long-lived.  For
        bootstrapping protocols that support ephemeral vouchers, there is no
        need to support revocations.  For bootstrapping protocols that support
        long-lived vouchers, the need to support revoking vouchers is a decision
        for each manufacturer.</t>

        <t>If revocations are not supported then voucher assignments are essentially
        forever, which may be acceptable for various kinds of devices. If revocations
        are supported, then it becomes possible to support various scenarios such as
        handling a key compromise or change in ownership.</t>

        <t>The voucher revocation format defined herein supports both issuer-wide
        (similar to a CRL) or voucher-specific (similar to an OCSP response)
        constructs, enabling usage flexibility.</t>

        <section title="Clock Sensitivity">
          <t>This document defines artifacts containing time values
          for voucher expirations and revocations, which
          require an accurate clock in order to be processed
          correctly.  Implementations MUST ensure devices have an
          accurate clock when shipped from manufacturing facilities,
          and take steps to prevent clock tampering.</t>
          <t>If it is not possible to ensure clock accuracy, it is
          RECOMMENDED that implementations disable the aspects of the
          solution having clock sensitivity. In particular, such
          implementations should assume that vouchers neither ever
          expire or are revokable.</t>
          <t>It is important to note that implementations SHOULD NOT
          rely on NTP for time, as it is not a secure protocol.</t>
