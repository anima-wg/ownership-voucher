  Voucher and Voucher Revocation Profiles for Bootstrapping Protocols
                      draft-ietf-anima-voucher-01

Abstract

   This document defines the "voucher" artifact, which is a YANG-defined
   structure that have been signed using a PKCS#7 structure.

   The voucher artifact is generated by the device's manufacture or
   delegate (i.e. the MASA).  The voucher's purpose is to securely
   assign one or more pledges to an owner.  The voucher informs each
   pledge which entity it should consider to be its owner.

   This document only defines the artifact, leaving it to future work to
   describe specialized protocols for accessing them.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a strategy to securely assign pledges to an
   owner, using an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the
   device's manufacturer.  This artifact is known as the voucher.

   A voucher may be useful in several contexts, but the driving
   motivation herein is to support secure bootstrapping mechanisms.
   This document only defines the voucher artifact, leaving it to other
   work to describe specialized protocols for accessing and distributing
   them (e.g., [draft-ietf-netconf-zerotouch],

   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join], and
   [draft-ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]).  Assigning ownership is
   important to bootstrapping mechanisms so that the pledge can
   authenticate the network that's trying to take control of it.

   The lifetimes of vouchers may vary.  In some bootstrapping protocols
   the vouchers may be ephemeral, whereas in others the vouchers may be
   potentially long-lived.  In order to support the second category of
   vouchers, this document also defines a voucher revocation artifact,
   enabling the MASA to communicate the ongoing validity of its
   vouchers.

   This document uses YANG [RFC7950] to define the voucher and voucher
   revocation formats.  YANG is a data modeling language with
   established mappings to XML and JSON, with mappings to other
   encodings in progress.  This document has selected JSON for document
   encodings.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses [draft-ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]
   terminology.  The new device is known as a "Pledge", which
   communicates with the "Join Registrar" of the owner's network, and
   the voucher is provided by the Manufacturer Authorized Signing
   Authority (MASA).

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the
   sections below are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

1.3.  Tree Diagram Notation

   The meaning of the symbols used in the tree-diagrams for YANG modules
   is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Braces "{" and "}" enclose feature names, and indicate that the
      named feature must be present for the subtree to be present.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" (read-write) represents
      configuration data and "ro" (read-only) represents state data.

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

1.4.  Secure Imprinting using Vouchers

   A voucher is a cryptographically protected statement to the Pledge
   device indicating authorizing a zero-touch "imprint" on the Join
   Registrar of the domain.  The voucher imparts the following
   information to the Join Registrar and Pledge:

   Assertion Basis:  Indicates the method that protects the imprint
      (this is distinct from the voucher signature that protects the
      voucher itself).  This might include manufacturer asserted
      ownership verification, assured logging operations or reliance on
      Pledge endpoint behavior such as secure root of trust of
      measurement.  The Join Registrar might use this information.  Only
      some methods are normatively defined in this document.  Other
      methods are left for future work.

   Authentication of Join Registrar:  Indicates how the Pledge can
      authenticate the Join Registrar.  This might include an indication
      of the private PKIX trust anchor used by the Registrar, or an
      indication of a public PKIX trust anchor and additional CN-ID or
      DNS-ID information to complete authentication.  Symmetric key or
      other methods are left for future work.

   Anti-Replay Protections:  Time or nonce based information to
      constrain the voucher to time periods or bootstrap attempts.

   A number of boostrapping scenarios can be met using differing
   combinations of this information.  All scenarios address the primary
   threat of a Man-in-The-Middle Registrar gaining control over the
   Pledge device.  The following combinations are referred to within
   this document by name.  Colloqually these are "types" of vouchers:

   -------------|----|-------|----------------|-------------|

     NOTE: All voucher types include a 'Pledge ID serial number'
           (Not shown for space reasons)

   Audit Voucher:  An Audit Voucher is named after the logging assertion
      mechanisms that the Registrar then "audits" to enforce local
      policy.  The Registrar mitigates a MiTM Registrar by auditing that
      an unknown MiTM registrar does not appear in the log entries.
      This does not direct prevent the MiTM but provides a response
      mechanism that ensures the MiTM is unsuccessful.  This advantage
      is that actual ownership knowledge is not required on the MASA
      service.

   Nonceless Audit Voucher:  An Audit Voucher without a validity period
      statement.  Fundamentally the same as an Audit Voucher except that
      it can be issued in advance to support network partitions or to
      provide a permanent voucher for remote deployments.

   Ownership Audit Voucher:  An Audit Voucher where the MASA service has
      verified the Registrar as the authorized owner.  The MASA service
      mitigates a MiTM Registrar by refusing to generate Audit Voucher's
      for unauthorized Registrars.  The Registrar uses audit techniques
      to supplement the MASA.  This provides an ideal sharing of policy
      decisions and enforcement between the vendor and the owner.

   Ownership ID Voucher:  An Ownership ID Voucher is named after
      inclusion of the Pledge's CN-ID or DNS-ID within the voucher.  An
      example Ownership Voucher is defined in
      [draft-ietf-netconf-zerotouch].  The MASA service mitigates a MiTM
      Registrar by identifying the specific Registrar authorized to own
      the Pledge.

Internet-Draft       Voucher and Revocation Profiles          March 2017


   Bearer Voucher:  A Bearer Voucher is named after the inclusion of a
      Registrar ID wildcard.  Because the Registrar identity is not
      indicated this voucher type must be treated as a secret and
      protected from exposure as any 'bearer' of the voucher can claim
      the Pledge device.  Publishing a nonceless bearer voucher
      effectively turns the specified Pledge into a "TOFU" device with
      minimal mitigation against MiTM Registrars.

2.  Voucher

   The voucher's purpose is to securely assign one or more pledges to an
   owner.  The voucher informs each pledge which entity it should
   consider to be its owner.

   The voucher is signed by the pledge's MASA, using the signing
   strategy described in Section Section 4.  This section describes the
   voucher document, before it has been signed.

2.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram (Section 1.3) illustrates a high-level
   view of a voucher document.  Each field in the voucher is fully
   described by the YANG module provided in Section 2.3.  Please see
   Section 2.3 for a detailed description of the Voucher format.


2.2.  Examples

   This section provides a couple Voucher examples for illustration
   purposes.

   The following example illustrates an ephemeral voucher (uses a nonce)
   encoded in JSON.  As is expected with a dynamically-generated
   voucher, only a single pledge (device-identifier) is specified.  The
   MASA generated this voucher using the 'logged' assertion type,
   knowing that it would be suitable for the pledge making the request.

   {
     "ietf-voucher:voucher": {
       "assertion": "logged",
       "trusted-ca-certificate": "base64-encoded X.509 DER",
       "owner-id": "Registrar3245",  # where did this field come from?
       "device-identifier": "JADA123456789",
       "created-on": "2016-10-07T19:31:42Z",
       "nonce": "base64-encoded octet string"
     }
   }

   The following illustrates a long-lived voucher (no nonce), encoded in
   XML.  This particular voucher applies to more than one pledge
   (unique-id), which might relate to, for instance, they were all
   issued as part of the same purchase order.  This voucher includes
   both a trust anchor certificate (trusted-ca-certificate) as well as
   some additional information (cn-id and dns-id) that can be used to
   identify a specific domain certificate issued, perhaps indirectly, by
   the trust anchor CA.

     "ietf-voucher:voucher": {
       "assertion": "verified",
       "trusted-ca-certificate": "base64-encoded X.509 DER",

3.  Voucher Revocation

   A revocation artifact is generally used to verify the continued
   validity of an assertion such as a PKIX certificate, web token, or a
   "voucher".  Conceptually revocation allows for issuance of assertions

Internet-Draft       Voucher and Revocation Profiles          March 2017


   using long lifetimes and thereby avoiding ongoing protocol operations
   to renew the assertion.  In practice the use of revocation artifacts
   increases the solution complexity.  Rather than a single protocol, or
   operation, to obtain or renew the assertion the resulting solution
   instead has two or more protocols: one for assertion maintenence and
   the other(s) for revocation verification.

   The PKIX use of CRLs and OCSP responses provides an illustrative
   example.  Relying parties that verify revocation information must
   obtain and parse the CRL or OCSCP information.  Each has its own
   validity period that effectively shortens the certificate validity
   period (since without valid revocation checks the certificate would
   be rejected).  In addition to having multiple revocation protocol
   options the resulting space is further complicated by inline
   distribution of the revocation information.  The TLS extension
   "Certificate Status Request" [RFC6066] for when "constrained clients
   may wish to use a certificate-status protocol" is an example of this.
   Including revocation information into Cryptographic Message Syntax
   [RFC5652] is another example.

   If vouchers included revocation similar complexities would propagate
   to all related voucher distribution and assertion protocols.  Instead
   vouchers DO NOT support revocation.  In all cases where the asserting
   party, or relying party, would obtain or distribute up to date
   revocation information instead the asserting party will obtain an up-
   to-date valid voucher.  The protocol and operations infrastructures
   for this are expected to be the same as the initial methods used to
   obtain a voucher in the first place with one important clarification:
   the MASA services MUST issue updated validity period vouchers to the
   same Registrar ID with minimal friction.  This is similar to how an
   OCSP revocation system is always willing to confirm that a
   certificate is not revoked.

   The lifetimes of vouchers may vary.  In some bootstrapping protocols
   the vouchers may be ephemeral, whereas in others the vouchers may be
   potentially long-lived.  For bootstrapping protocols that support
   ephemeral vouchers, there is no need to support revocations.  For
   bootstrapping protocols that support long-lived vouchers final
   protocol complexity is reduced when short lifetime vouchers are
   easily renewed rather than layering on additional revocation methods.
   Manufacturers MAY issue long-lived vouchers to customers if required
   but no revocation method is described.

4.  Signing Strategy

   Both the Voucher and Voucher Revocation are signed using a PKCS#7
   SignedData structure, as specified by Section 9.1 of RFC 2315, having

   the 'content' be JSON-encoded data conforming to the YANG modules
   described in sections Section 2 and Section 3.

   Both the Voucher and Voucher Revocation PKCS#7 structures MAY contain
   additional structures deemed useful.  For instance the Voucher
   structure MAY also contain all of the certificates leading up to and
   including a root-level trust anchor certificate.  Likewise, the
   Voucher Revocation structure MAY also include the CRL or OCSP
   Response for each of the certificates that MAY be stapled to the
   Voucher structure.

   If the Registrar Identity is compromised then any outstanding voucher
   for that Registrar Identity could be used by the attacker.  The
   domain administrator is clearly expected to initiate revocation of
   any domain identity certificates.  Similarly they are expected to
   contact the voucher signing authority to indicate that such
   outstanding (presumably short lifetime) voucher be blocked from
   automated renewal.  Protocols for voucher distribution are
   RECOMMENDED to check for revocation of any domain identity
   certificates before automated renewal of vouchers.

5.  Design Considerations

5.1.  Voucher Per Pledge

   The solution originally enabled a single voucher to apply to many
   pledges, using lists of regular expressions to represent device
   identifiers.  However, when thinking about blocking renewal of
   vouchers, it was decided that blocking such a voucher would be
   excessive when only the ownership of a single pledge needed to be
   blocked.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Clock Sensitivity

   This document defines artifacts containing time values for voucher
   expirations, which require an accurate clock in order to be processed
   correctly.  Vendors planning on issuing vouchers with time values
   MUST ensure devices have an accurate clock when shipped from
   manufacturing facilities, and take steps to prevent clock tampering.

   If it is not possible to ensure clock accuracy then nonce based
   validity period vouchers SHOULD be used.  When necessary nonce-less,
   or long validity vouchers, can be issued with the understanding that
   there is no revocation method available (if a revocation method was
   possible then shorter lifetime vouchers would also have been an
   option).

   It is important to note that implementations SHOULD NOT rely on NTP
   for time, as it is not a secure protocol.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers two URIs in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].

      Registrant Contact: The ANIMA WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

7.2.  The YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].  Following the format defined in [RFC6020], the
   the following registrations are requested:

      name:         ietf-voucher
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-voucher
